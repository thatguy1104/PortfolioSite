Our discussions were aimed towards discovering user requirements to form a coherent understanding of basic functionalities and qualitative characteristics of the product to be delivered. Unfortunately, detailed specifications could not be gathered due to the multiplicity of functional requests and the absence of the fourth client, an additional meeting is to be set up with each client individually to gain intricate insight into individual demands.</p>

Furthermore, the team has been working on constructing and planning the interviews to be conducted with users. So far, our group has constructed an abstract Persona based on generalized data, however, it is still to be developed as we interview more users. We are also having a scheduled client interview with Ann on Wednesday (28.10.2020) and with Simon (29.10.2020). Our goal is to have a complete understanding of the requirements and a plan for working taking a user-centered approach to design.</p>

                                        <p>Last week our team has met with Ann, our fourth client, a meeting that has proved very useful for our general understanding. A meeting with Simon Knowles and Allen Richard was vital to understand the way one would use keywords in the classification of ongoing research and teaching. He has shared several suggestions for potential data sources, describing the advantages and disadvantages of each. On Monday 02/11/2020 my team and I conducted a meeting with Karolina, Marilyn, and Ann. We received some insight into Karolina's work, as well as a data file, which we aim to extend as part of the project. Our next steps include conducting a team meeting to process given data sources and evaluate which are fit for us to start with.</p>

We are yet to contact the clients regarding this source. So far, the team has researched various deployment and DevOps platforms and evaluated them (can be accessed on the UCL5 MieMie website). Next steps including updating the website with further details and produce sample data to confirm with the clients (to be done due to 25/11/2020).</p>

Our team has discussed the need for RPS access, however, eventually were persuaded to use existing sources such as Web of Science and Scopus to perform string search. I have scheduled a supplementary meeting for Thursday with one of the researchers (not one of our clients) to demonstrate how to exercise the search given a provided static data report from RPS. In the meantime, other group members are working on developing an NLP model or source to parse out keywords from a block of text. Additionally, we have kicked off the process of scraping the UCL Module Catalogue - which is a requirement for one of our clients.</p>

At the moment, we have started developing an NLP keyword extraction model and will begin training on and validating the Scopus sample training set. Consequently, we plan to then apply the same model on the UCL Module Catalogue data that have finished scraping earlier this week. We set out goals and spread out the workload, as well as agreed on particular deadlines and team meetings that will be conducted throughout the upcoming winter break.</p>

We plan to have some base data from Scopus within the next two weeks and start model training as soon as the pre-processing is complete. The end goal for Scopus is to accumulate a total of 229,967 point dataset of publications and their details by UCL researchers.</p>

Following that, we partitioned the data into test and validation sets using a 70 to 30 split. Now that our data is in the correct format, we fed it into the Support Vector Machine classification algorithm to train our model. Additionally, we have scraped sample data from Scopus, however, still resolving a few issues regarding missing data and the possibility of using different calls to gather various parts of the data to comprise the whole picture.</p>

I have finally figured out the long-lasting issue - data access through the API. Previously, there has been a restriction placed, which was solved by using UCL VPN to access data points like an abstract, author identifiers as well as data on the author's affiliation. This allowed the construction of a clean JSON format file for each of the research publications. So far, as a demo version, I have put together ~1300 such files. It allowed us to focus on feeding that abstract data into the SVM model. We plan to continue cleaning up that data and to get started on SDG -> UCL Module Catalogue classification.</p>

                                        <p>This week, we have met with one of our clients regarding his particular request for SDG mapping to UCL Module Catalogue. The issue is that we are unable to perform the training process without the annotated data. However, there are over 5500 modules to annotate. Hence, we contacted our TA, who has approved an alternative decision - to map the modules solely based on a statistical analysis of keywords present. Therefore, we continued using TF-IDF and automated the process of meaningful keyword extraction from the module descriptions and pushed the data in a formatted manner onto the Azure database table. Our next step is to continue that work and get started on the Bubble Chart generation, given that we already possess the Scopus research publications data.</p>

Bubble Chart generation is challenging, since data used to be comprised manually and we aim to automate the topic generation & matching of that topic to the author & index keywords from the data gathered through the Scopus API. Our plan for the rest of the week is to continue our work on the chart generation and continue SDG -> module catalogue matching. To further note, last Friday, we have successfully presented our project's Elevator Pitch.</p>

                                        <p>The team made progression towards mapping UCL modules from the module catalogue to SDGs (sustainable development goals). Through the research of many different NLP and machine learning algorithms, we have decided to use the semi-supervised LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) algorithm called GuidedLDA. This version of the general LDA algorithm allows us to use SDG keywords provided by our client, as seed topics. The model then encourages topics to be built around these seed words, with some set confidence, whilst also uncovering more words related to a given topic. This reference point lets us classify known topics more easily, without the need for manual annotation, by allowing the topics to converge in the direction specified by the SDG keywords.</p>

                                        <p>This week our team has had an additional client meeting regarding the Bubble Chart. We requested the source code for its implementation and deployment. Once received, we began reverse-engineering its structure and attempting to understand how the "approach" and "speciality" categories are assigned. We continued the work on the GuidedLDA algorithm by focusing on applying it to the scraped data and figuring out how to then validate the results. A proposed solution is to sue the simple string matched results as a validation set, however, it is still yet to be evaluated.</p>

                                        <p>Our group has continued working on LDA implementation. Additionally, during one of our client meetings, the client proposed a general-purpose search functionality for the data we have so far accumulated. Hence, we plan to implement a tight-search (plain matching algorithm without pre-processing) using robust string matching algorithms: Rabin-Karp (with window running hash technique),  Boyer-Moore algorithm (using bad character table with a good suffix table). On another note, we ran into a few issues with the data for the Bubble Chart, as we managed to deconstruct the sqlite3 database, however, the data there has been assigned without an obvious script that performs the matching of a researcher with his/her speciality and approach.</p>

                                        <p>Upon our meeting with Neel and Simon to catch up on our progress, I have immediately started the development of the Django Search Engine Web Application. It will interface the back-end data and provide extensive search functionality and detailed view for both modules and publications. In the meantime, our group has finally implemented the GuidedLDA algorithm for our data, however, the results are not perfect and need to be tuned. Hence, four solutions were proposed, including using Tf-IDF Vectoriser, including stop-words to prevent detection of unnecessary keywords (such as "module" or "student") and finally, using modules that have a direct string-matched mapping, to prevent redundant processing and reduce GuidedLDA skewing.</p>

Our team is having a meeting today to get a final stamp of approval from Neel to signify the completion of his specific requirement to the project. On a different note, the team has progressed immensely with the GuidedLDA optimisation. However, it has become clear that LDA should be used and has proved to produce more valuable results. Hence, we are now able to assign each UCL module to a UN Sustainable Development Goal, as well as demonstrate potential relevance/overlap with other goals. The next step includes further testing of the model. Moreover, Marilyn has requested a similar model testing using keywords relating to Digital Health and Engineering. If the model proves insightful, we shall apply it to this area too.</p>

                                        <p>This week our team has focused on model tuning, by the end of which, we were happy to see great results. Specifically, the keywords assigned to each SDG were accurate and relevant. Moreover, SDG mapping to modules that do not have any relation to any SDG was consistently accurate, and similarly with modules that have SDG relevancy. By the same token, although the model has been trained on module data, it performed just as well when applied to unseen Scopus publication data. Furthermore, we conducted a meeting with Simon and Richard (UCL researcher, not in the client group) to gather feedback on current progress. It was suggested we pursue model validation by comparing results to simple string matched classification. In order to visualise the mappings, we have developed a second page in our Django web application, with similar searching functionality and checkbox for the preferred view option. Our next steps are to develop validation scrips, improve the Django interface and figure out our deployment and cloud hosting solution.</p>
