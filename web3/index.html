                        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                            <p>The researchers and academics of UCL require an in-depth breakdown of other researchers who are working within the same area; however, this is a long and arduous process that currently requires a manual search and verification process, one that can take months to complete and would make research much more effective if sped up. This is becoming a larger issue as there are more researchers every year, and this process must be completed annually which causes an increasing problem every time this process is redone.</p>
                            <br>
                        <h4>Our Solution</h4>
                            <p>Our solution is to automate this process for all areas of research by allowing researchers to search for all other academics using various filters using scraping tools across UCL related websites before cleaning the data and processing it into various forms of visualisations for the researchers to use. This process would be automatically updated each year to include new publications and researchers in order to constantly shorten the time period.</p>

                                                        <p>Our project came about due to a growing need within UCL, centred around the research facility in which their research administration, namely finding various things based on their topic of research such as names and other key terms. This search was taking longer and longer each year due to the increasing number of articles, papers and other publications on each topic coming out each year. This got us connected to various researchers varying from professors, PhD research students and sustainable development researchers. They all required a method to speed up this process and to help get more accurate data automatically rather than repeating this each year manually.</p>

                                                        <p>Our main project goals include trying to achieve a way for all researchers to be able to find and contact other researchers that are working on or have worked on the same field of study as them. The project goals also include trying to ensure that the RPS database can be scraped in order to find all papers that are linked to the search field used that can then be used to find all related researchers.</p>

                                                    <p>We gathered various requirement in the form of a MOSCOW list that was created through a series of group and individual meetings with each of our clients in order to gather all the features and methods that are needed as well as the priority of each of these. We went over these features multiple times with our clients and added a few as well as splitting up other requirements into different parts.</p>

                                                    <p>Alison has trouble identifying researchers to collaborate with across the IHE. She would like to use this tool as a quick and efficient way of searching for researchers across different engineering fields. She wants to establish connections across UCL and monitor the progress of her colleagues.</p>
                                                    <p>Jonathan is a PhD researcher who would use this data tool in order to quickly find and sort through different research topics that have or currently are conducted at his university. He aims to gain insight into the extent to which UCL is involved in promotion of the 2015 UN’s Sustainable Development Goals in both teaching and research.</p>

Inspired by the IDH Bubble Chart, the aim of this project is to update the original version with new information and themed-based categories that include the wider breadth of healthcare engineering expertise across IHE.

The code base itself resides on a GitHub repository. The idea is to perform an initial large scale scrape, gathering initial set of data in a structured and normalised manner. Upon completion, the next step involves a different set of programs that run with the purpose of checking the source data set for potential updates / changes to the data. If any change is observed, the scripts are to stage a validation on the project’s data.</p>

Azure Functions allows time the scrapes, where the python file object is passed to the azure.functions.TimerRequest object to perform a set operation.

The methodology described by Macquarie University Sustainability Department is to collect together different subthemes and map each subtheme onto each SDG. The information was given in a table where each subtheme is a row of the table and each SDG is a column of the table.</p>
                                                        <br><p><b>Proposed Solution</b></p>
                                                            <p>Our first solution to carry out the mapping is to do a string search through the description of a module for each SDG-specific keyword, count the number of occurrences of each keyword and sum those up for each SDG (sustainable development goal). However, this approach has many flaws. If the module description contains very little or doesn’t contain any SDG-specific keywords but still teaches students about many of the SDGs then data integrity is lost, causing modules to have inaccurate labels. Moreover, we have the same problem if a module contains many of the SDG-specific keywords but doesn’t educate students about the SDGs.</p>
                                                            <p>Improving on the string matching approach, our next solution aims to carry out the mapping by manually annotating each module from the UCL module catalogue to a subset of the SDGs. However, we believe this solution to be outside the scope of our knowledge since we would need a greater understanding of how the SDG-specific keywords were compiled and teaching across different faculties and departments. Our annotation will be inaccurate, biased and very time consuming to annotate over 5000 UCL modules. However, with more time and research this approach will the best in terms of accuracy and reliability.</p>
                                                            <p>The proposed solution is very similar to the subtheme approach by Macquarie University. We have decided to use semi-supervised LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) called GuidedLDA. The reason for using semi-supervised LDA instead of the general LDA (topic modelling) algorithm is that it allows us to control the generated topics by using the SDG-specific keywords as seed topics. Thus, each generated topic corresponds to one of the 17 SDGs. The model encourages topics to be built around these seed words, with some set confidence, whilst also uncovering more words. By using the seeded topics (SDG-specific keywords) as a reference point, it allows us to classify known topics more easily without manually annotating over 5000 UCL modules. Thus, encouraging topics to converge in the direction specified by the SDG-specific keywords.</p>

                                                            <p>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an unsupervised topic modelling algorithm used to classify text in a document to a topic. The aim of LDA is to find topics which best describe a corpus of documents, which in our case are the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the UCL module catalogue respectively. LDA manages a topic per document model and words per topic model, both of which use Dirichlet distributions from probability theory. The words per topic model describes how to compute the probability of a word belonging to a particular topic, whereas the topic per document model describes for each document the probability a topic is related to that document. This model should be used to finalize the mapping of UCL modules to SDGs.</p>
                                                            <p>The interface for the GuidedLDA follows conventions from the scikit-learn machine learning library. It has been production trained on half a million documents, ran predictions on millions and manually checked thousands of topics. The algorithmic design is explained in the paper <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E12-1021.pdf">“Incorporating Lexical Priors into Topic Models” by J. Jagarlamudi, H. Daume III and R. Udupa</a>. The paper explains how priors (seeded words) can be set into a topic model to guide it in the right direction.</p>
                                                            <p>The seeded words should be representative of the underlying topics in a corpus. It uses these seeds to improve topic-word distributions and document-topic distributions. To improve the topic-word distribution, each topic prefers to generate words that are related to the words in the seed set. To improve the document-topic distribution, the model is encouraged to select document-level topics based on the existence of seed words in a document.</p>
                                                            <p>Another method of performing the mapping is document clustering. The model described in the paper uses a baseline (maxCluster) which counts the number of tokens in each document from each of the seed topics and assigns the document to the seed topic which has the most tokens, resulting in a clustering of documents based on the seed topic assigned to them. The purpose of this baseline is to evaluate the effectiveness of the SDG keywords for our module catalogue corpus, and to use it as a means of validation for the SDG mapping with GuidedLDA.</p>

LDA takes a corpus of documents, assuming that the words in each document are related. Our job is to tell LDA how many topics to construct, in our case there are 17 topics (one for each SDG) and it uses the algorithm described above to generate topic and word distributions over the corpus.</p>

                                                        <p><b>First Part: Scraping UCL Module Catalogue</b></p>
                                                        <p>As the first step, it was necessary to gain insight into the extent to which UCL is able to deliver the key ideologies outlined in the <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals" target="_blank">2015 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals</a> (hereafter SDGs) through teaching. Hence, the UCL Module Catalogue was proposed as a data source for natural language processing and categorisation. Initially, the <a href="https://uclapi.com/docs/" target="_blank">UCL API</a> was used to comprise a unique module link. For example, the API provided module name - “Neurology and Neurosurgery - Basic” and module identification “CLNE0012”, which was then used to concatenate to form a final module link - https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/neuromuscular-literature-review-CLNE0010. The data as such was stored in the <i>all_module_links.json</i> file for future use and can be updated by running the <i>initialise_files.py</i> file in the MODULE_CATALOGUE/INITIALISER directory. Consequently, that unique link was piped into the "BeautifulSoup" Python library to obtain a webpage html file data for all 5576 modules (at the time of conducting the project).</p>
                                                            <br><img src="img/scrapingDiagram.png" alt="Prototype 1" class="personas"><br>
                                                        <p>Object oriented programming allowed us for greater control of instantiation, encapsulation and abstraction of data mining scripts. Specifically, it was useful in abstraction of initialisation, specifically, obtaining all module-related and departmental metadata. Thus, by running <i>global_controller.py</i> one may instantiate all necessary files to proceed with the module-to-SDG mapping process. The following data points were obtained: module title, module ID, faculty, department, credit value, module lead name and description. Upon processing each one of those strings into cleaner form, the data was organised into a tuple and stored in a list and pushed to the ModuleData table in the MainDB database using “pyodbc” Python library.</p>

                                                        <p>It is worth noting that the processes described below formed a part in a back-up, alternative approach to SDG mapping. Due to an issue with large dataset annotation, it was agreed with our clients that this change was necessary for delivering an improvement into the current classification processes.</p>

The processing file - <i>map.py</i> also pulls the data from ModuleData database table, which contains all data relating to a particular module, including its description, title, credit value, module lead name and so on. It uses that data to comprise a single string, which alongside a single keyword is piped into a pre-processing unit, which uses NLTK to lemmatise the given strings. Lastly, the algorithm checks whether or not that keyword is present in any text data in a particular module, if so, it stores it into the <i>matchedModulesSDG.json</i> file.</p>

The only difference is the type of data considered. Scopus provides more details about a particular publication, therefore, it allows for greater comparison and a more accurate matching. In this case, data points like abstract, title, author keywords, index keywords and subject area keywords are considered during string comparison. As a result, it generates the matchedScopusSDG.json file for further development.</p>

Hence, in order to apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm called GuidedLDA, it is necessary to extract keywords that are representative of that particular module. Diagram above shows the processing stages of the <i>access_module_data.py</i> script. Firstly, it uses a database written by previous scrips to organise module metadata, then concatenates any strings that will be used. NLTK is used to preprocess the text data, which is then piped into the Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectoriser to perform a numerical statistic which will indicate the significance of each word, essentially demonstrating how reflective that word is of a particular collection of text data. Consequently, top 5 were taken, excluding any that have a significance less than 0.001. The resulting keywords, alongside the module identifications string are written to the ModuleKeywords database table hosted in Microsoft Azure server. The module identification string is specified as a primary key for ease of data retrieval.</p>

The GuidedLDA library uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation internally with topic seeds, which guide the algorithm and help it converge around those seeds (SDG keywords). The topic seeds are only used during initialization, whereby the seed words are much more likely to be matched with their corresponding topic seed. <a href="https://guidedlda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">(Link to Source)</a></p>

The gensim API provides simple pre-processing methods for converting a document into a list of lowercase tokens and stopwords. NLTK provides more stopwords, a part of speech tagger, the WordNetLemmatizer class for lemmatization and SnowballStemmer class for stemming. The CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer classes from the sci-kit learn machine learning library are used to create a document-term matrix. This matrix forms the features of our model. The CountVectorizer class converts a collection of raw text documents to a matrix of token counts, whereas the TfidfVectorizer class converts the raw documents to a matrix of TF-IDF features.</p>

The input consists of documents which are a substring of the module description for 4 different UCL modules and synthetic SDG-specific keywords for 17 different SDGs (numbering is not accurate). The output consists of topics with a set of words weighted by how important a word is for a given topic and documents with a set of topics weighted by how likely a topic is related to a given document. We did not train a model for this dummy dataset, but merely made-up the inputs and outputs but is supposed to demonstrate how the mapping will work.</p>

                                                            <p>Applying Natural Language Processing to the corpus produces a bag of words model for each document followed by a document-term matrix using CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer. The words are randomly assigned a topic but are largely influenced by the SDG-specific keywords. For example, the word marine in MECH0019 has a greater chance of being assigned to SDG 3 than SDG 1 because marine ∈ {marine, fishing, coastal, coral reef} which are the keywords for SDG 3. Following the random topic assignment, a word-topic matrix is produced where each cell is the number of times a word has been assigned to a topic and a document-topic matrix is produced where each cell is the number of times a topic comes up in a particular document.</p>
                                                            <p>Following the algorithm for GuidedLDA in the research section, it computes the proportion of words in a document that are assigned to a topic and the proportion of assignments to a topic across all documents that come from a particular word. Now, update the probability of a word belonging to a topic as the product of these two values and reassign a topic for the word. This procedure only counts as one iteration for the GuidedLDA. In practice, we train our model on hundreds of iterations to help it converge, yielding much more accurate results.</p>
                                                            <p>For the dummy dataset example, the GEOG0036 module on Water and Development in Africa is most related to SDG 1: No Poverty with a score of 0.5 and the MECH0019 module on Ocean Engineering Fundamentals is most related to SDG 3 with a score of 0.9. This makes the most sense because the keywords for SDG 3 are {marine, fishing, coastal, coral reef} which is meant to represent the SDG Goal 14 on Life Below Water - “Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development.”</p>

                                                        <p>The strategy of testing the validation of our model training results is to use a combination of mathematical concepts from machine learning:</p>
                                                        <ul class="ordered">
                                                            <li><p>Cosine similarity</p></li>
                                                            <li><p>Squashing function</p></li>
                                                        </ul>
                                                        <p>Cosine similarity is used to compare the angle between vectors A,B∈<math>R<sub>+</sub><sup>n</sup></math>, where in our case n= 1 8 and each component a<sub>i</sub>∈A for i=1,2,…,18 is the probability the model predicted for how much a document is related to SDG i and each component b<sub>i</sub>∈B for i=1,2,…,18 is the ratio of keyword counts for SDG i. From these assumptions, two properties hold:</p>
                                                        <ul class="ordered">
                                                            <li><p>‖A‖=1 and ‖B‖=1</p></li>
                                                            <li><p>
                                                            <math>A,B∈R<sub>+</sub><sup>n</sup>  ⟹ ∀a<sub>i</sub>∀b<sub>i</sub>(a<sub>i</sub> ≥ 0)∧(b<sub>i</sub>i ≥ 0) ⟹ ∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup>a<sub>i</sub>b<sub>i</sub> ≥ 0 ⟹ 〈A,B〉 ≥ 0 ⟹ 〈A,B〉/‖A‖‖B‖ ≥ 0 ⟹ cos(θ<sub>A,B</sub>) ≥ 0</math></p></li>
                                                        </ul>

                                                        <p>From these properties we can deduce that: <math>cos(θ<sub>A,B</sub>) =〈A,B〉/‖A‖‖B‖</math></p>
                                                        <p>A squashing function f:X→Y is a bijective function where X=<math>R<sup>+</sup></math> and Y=[0,1] maps any input x in <math>R<sup>+</sup></math> to f(x) in the range [0,1]. In our case, x is the number of keyword occurrences and if f(x) is close to 1 then it gives a greater belief for the similarity of 2 vectors whereas if f(x) is close to 0 then it is unlikely that 2 vectors are similar, since the count will be very low.</p>
                                                        <p>f:<math>R<sup>+</sup></math>→[0,1] exists s.t. f(x)=1/2(tanh(ax-b)+1) where a,b are scalable constants.</p>
                                                        <br><img src="img/tanh.png" alt="Sigmoid Function" class="personas" style="width: 50%; height: 230px;"><br>
                                                        <p>The similarity is computed as <math>Sim(A,B) = cos(θ<sub>A,B</sub>)∙f(x)</math> which also has range [0,1].</p>
                                                        <p>Other testing strategies not explicitly related to machine learning are using assert statements throughout the code which are the condition or Boolean expression which should always be true in any instance of running the code. Failing an assert inside a function means the function was incorrectly called or the data passed to it is incorrect. For example, when using our model to make a prediction on the DOI of a research paper, we have an assert that the length of the dataframe is equal to 1, otherwise if the length is 0 then an invalid DOI was provided.</p>

                                                        <p><b>Neel Desai</b></p>
                                                            <p>The project partners feedback upon trying out our project product was positive. This is a novel tool that utilises a machine learning model to gather a clear picture of UCL’s modules and publications, specifically, analysing and visualising the extent to which the institution is able to deliver UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) ideologies through teaching and research. For Neel’s requirements, we achieved to cover all functionalities requested, with which he was pleased. Moreover, his additional request for including export functionality was quickly implemented. The final demonstration reveals that the solution works for the user, providing appropriate output, with minimum loading time of the Django interface. The application has proved itself as easy to navigate. Furthermore, the web-app provides error messaged when trying to export empty fields (when search resolves no matches for instance), allowing the user to understand and recover from this error without losing search input and current checkboxes’ state.</p>
                                                            <p>With regards to another user group that aims to understand and view SDG mappings, a second page of the Django web-app was developed. The team conducted numerous meetings to test the application with the user, to gain insight on whether or not the data displayed is useful and the site is usable. The webpage provides multiple functionalities that had to be individually tested with the user present, to ensure that one is able to recover from accidental input. Consequently, software tested revealed that it is able to handle required tasks in accordance with the specifications and design requirements.</p>

                                                            <p>The feedback given to us by our client, Simon Knowles and project partner, Richard Allen from our original prototype demonstration emphasised on validating the model training results by comparing those results with SDG keyword string matching counts as an alternative method for mapping modules to SDGs. Furthermore, our clients wanted more data and visualisation describing a “bigger picture” of the mapping from UCL modules to SDGs. One of their requests was a bubble map diagram where each bubble represents an SDG, whose area is proportional to the number of students being taught about that particular SDG. In regard to this feedback, we were given a spreadsheet of the number of students against module reference numbers (e.g. FREN0074) so that we were able to produce the appropriate diagram:</p>

                                                            <p>In addition, we extended the UI to give a visual representation of the validation process, which was comparing the similarity of the results obtained by our model to those obtained using a simple keyword string matching algorithm. Further filtering options were added to filter the table by comparing the similarity of modules to the values input by the user:</p>

                                                    <h4>Why This Test, Which Tool, How The Test Was Conducted, Results & Analysis</h4>
                                                        <p>One of the issues encountered when gathering data from Scopus using pybibliometrics - an API wrapper was invalid DOIs. Our team was provided with a UCL Research Publications Service extract, containing a list of unique publication identifiers. However, not all exist in Scopus records. Hence, the script would either crash when encountering a non-existent DOI or would identify a paper as invalid due to other errors. Hence, it was necessary to test whether the error raised was purely due to invalidity of the DOI.</p>
                                                        <p>The tool we picked was Postman - a software tool for API call testing. The test was conducted on a semi-manual basis. More specifically, upon monitoring the log files, which report both successful API package admission and failed ones, we would validate suspicious DOIs in Postman, which eliminates the need to have a development environment and isolating the API call.</p>

Hence, the code would seem as if it is performing well, however, it may just make a call to a wrongly formatted DOI string or the key may have exceeded the allocated quota limit.</td>

                                                        <p><b>User Interface & User Experience</b></p>
                                                            <p>Django web application was a surprising addition to our requirements, due to a demand to interface the back-end data and provide extensive search functionality and detailed view for both modules and publications. It is a necessary addition to our requirements, as it would benefit other clients to perform searches and potentially other users of the platform. The web interface provides notable value to the project, proving itself as the most suitable approach to separating the concerns of each program, dealing with specific client requirements and considering the user’s goals. The interface provides a technical challenge with regards to fast performance. The choice for the Django framework is justified in its leverage of function-based view by composing a model (an abstracted version of SQL table creation) and its wrapper for interacting with the SQLite database. It allows for sophisticated “Q” object filtering, essentially performing a fast search on all fields of the object and effectively coordinating its display due to Model View Controller design architecture.</p>
                                                            <p>With regards to user experience, it was necessary to retain user-centred development, to make the application usable, easy to learn and ensure that in case of error, the user can understand and recover from unintentional input or navigation. To achieve the aforementioned, we conducted regular update meetings with individuals who classify as potential user group (in this case these were UCL undergraduate students). Moreover, as confirmation that the interface is appropriate and provides valuable insight into the data scraped, we conducted client meetings as confirmation of our progress. All in all, Django’s advantageous qualities progressively improved our project’s progression towards achieving client requirements and its purpose. Despite the potential to improve the visual aspect of the webpages, rigorous user acceptance testing has demonstrated immense value in data visualisation and the ability to perform search operations across all the scraped data.</p>
                                                        <br>
                                                        <p><b>Functionality</b></p>
                                                            <p>The scraping of data from the UCL module catalogue and Scopus research publications work well and get the required information in JSON format except that certain faculties such as Law are not included in the UCL API, thus we are unable to scrape any modules from such faculties. However, we believe this limitation to be okay, since using the UCL API eases the scraping of modules across the entirety of UCL.</p>
                                                            <p>The NLP scripts used to pre-process text from the UCL module catalogue description and the abstract from Scopus research publications achieve the goals of normalization, lemmatization and stopword removal. We avoid stemming the tokens, in our case, since it makes the tokens less understandable when trying to validate the topic-word distribution at the end of training the model. For stopword removal, we provide additional stopwords that were compiled from examining the UCL module catalogue. For example, {lecturer, coursework, class} is a subset of these additional stopwords. Most of these words don’t provide any additional information related to the SDG topic-word distribution, however certain words like “class” are contained within the SDG keywords csv file but “class” (for SDG 1: No Poverty) has a different semantic meaning in the module catalogue dataset to that from within the SDG keywords csv file. Thus, it is important that we include “class” in the stopwords list to avoid confusing model training and skewing the results towards SDG 1 (since we assume words have no semantic meaning associated with them).</p>
                                                            <p>However, our NLP script does perform the required functionality of classifying and mapping UCL modules to SDGs, with validation as described in the Testing section of the report, even though we lose small pieces of information by removing stopwords and making the necessary semantic meaning assumptions that greatly simplify the model design.</p>

                                                        <p><b>Stability</b></p>
                                                            <p>It was vital to develop scraping scripts that are error-prone and can rapidly recover from an error. Specifically, disruption of network connection or internal error causes data loss, as in some scripts particularly, the data is loaded in n-sized chunks. Hence, if the error occurs towards the limit of the chunk, a large amount of data ends up lost. Ergo, the scrips implemented recovery mechanisms for avoiding situations of null values, invalid API requests. Moreover, the most challenging aspect of that design is adapting the script to deal with varying HTML page data for querying module data from the UCL module catalogue website. The fields of description may often be located at different tag positions, and in some cases is missing. Hence, a multi-layer checking procedure was introduced to deal with the aforementioned inconsistencies, enforcing the overall system’s performance stability.</p>

                                                        <p><b>Efficiency</b></p>
                                                            <p>Efficiency was key in the design of web-scrapers. It is a lengthy and computationally heavy process, considering that there is large amounts of string processing, as well as the organisation of data into an appropriate data structure and its storage. Hence, it was vital to program in a way that would involve the least amount of rewriting data and choosing data structures wisely. Specifically, the use of dictionaries (or hash-maps) allowed for fast O(1) access for cases of Scopus data, where a lot of metadata has to be accessed immediately for Django SQLite model synchronisation.</p>
                                                            <p>For our implementation of the guided LDA model, we use the LdaMulticore module in gensim. LdaMulticore is an optimized implementation of the LDA algorithm, able to harness the power of multicore CPUs to parallelize and speed up model training. The optimal number of workers, w=<i>cpu_count-1</i> where <i>cpu_count</i> is the number of real CPU cores (not hyperthreads) on the computer the model is trained on. For theoretical reasons, this value achieves optimal performance. The LDA training in gensim conceptually consists of Expectation-Maximization, which is an iterative method to find (local) maximum likelihood estimates of LDA parameters, with alternating E-steps and M-steps. The E-step performs inference on a chunk of documents using a Kalman filter. The statistics collected in the E-step are accumulated and used to update the model in M-step. To improve performance of the EM algorithm, the E-step is distributed to several workers as part of the LdaMulticore implementation. In comparison with LdaModel which is single-core and needs to be trained overnight, LdaMulticore speeds up the training process to less than an hour on a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor with 6 CPU cores (5 workers).</p>
                                                            <p>For the NLP pre-processing scripts, which are responsible for converting the text to lowercase, removing words which are less than 3 characters and lemmatization, the time complexity is linear with the length of the text, O(<i>n</i>) in the average case. Furthermore, stopword removal which is done by the TfidfVectorizer class takes O(<i>n⋅m</i>) time, where n is the length of the text and m is the length of the stopwords list. The computational time complexity of TF-IDF is O(<i>nL⋅log(nL)</i>) where n is the total number of sequences in the dataset and <i>L</i> is the average length of sequences in the dataset.</p>

                                                        <p><b>Compatibility</b></p>
                                                            <p>One of the services our project delivers is a web application, purposed to share the data mining engine with the public. Ergo, the application is compatible with all devices with access to a browser and an internet connection. However, if one considers management, compatibility becomes a more complex issue. Firstly, the compatibility of the deployment environment is vital to consider. A platform such as python-anywhere is not compatible with our project, due to the presence of external call to the Microsoft SQL Server on Azure, which is not permitted. Moreover, the deployment environment needs to be configured to handle a large number of static files generated from Scopus scraping. However, assuming the application is deployed, the interfaced aspect of the web application is universally accessible to the general public. Thus, it is fair to conclude that compatibility is not a significant concern.</p>

                                                            <p>This is very much maintainable as our scraper can scrape from an updated version of the same data source and extract the new data that would then be added to the current data. This data can also be processed the same way each year as it would be in the same format. Furthermore, if any of the previous data points are changed or edited in any sort of way, these would also be updated, since our scraper looks at the entire database each time. This can also be used on other data sources, without large modifications, which means that the product can be changed based on future needs and requirements from other uses.</p>

                                                            <ul class="ordered">
                                                                <li><p>Tuning the GuidedLDA model to achieve a lower perplexity and fewer false positives. Normalizing the eta priors and lowering these values will help but we were unable to do so without the model giving us unwanted topics. Alternatively, it is also valuable to experiment with a KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) algorithm that finds the k-closest topic vectors to the input document vector.</p></li>
                                                                <li><p>Scraping additional modules from the UCL module catalogue. Unfortunately, we were unable to scrape modules from the Faculty of Laws using the UCL API, since it doesn’t include any information about this faculty. An alternative approach for scraping these modules needs to be considered.</p></li>
                                                                <li><p>Applying a supervised machine learning algorithm on the SDG mapping of GuidedLDA. It is worth experimenting with a Naïve Bayes classifier, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression or a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The labels associated with a UCL module can be obtained from the GuidedLDA model (recommended) or by counting the occurrences of keywords for each SDG in the module description.</p></li>
                                                                <li><p>A better approach would be to do a survey asking a subset of lecturers across different faculties at UCL which SDGs they believe their teaching corresponds to. This would be very helpful to validate and improve the mapping results. Furthermore, they can look into SDG mapping of modules from different universities and compare SDGs to those predicted by their model.</p></li>
                                                                <li><p>Semantic analysis can be used to improve SDG mapping. SDG 1: No Poverty contains the keyword “class” which has a different meaning most of the time to where “class” is used in the UCL module catalogue, which is used to refer to a group of students who are taught together. Thus, to avoid confusion, we add “class” to our list of stopwords.</p></li>

                                <p>We have worked hard to ensure that our project completely follow all licensing, copyright and GDPR law. Although no data was collected under GDPR, we do have names of various authors of publications being collected, as well as the names of professors who teach different modules across UCL; however, this information is already publicly available and does not constitute a need for any confidentiality. In line with UK copyright, using the Scopus API stays in line with the moral right that all authors have which means that they are always credited for their own work. We further have a strict contractual relationship, defined through the conditions set within our MoSCoW list (see above). As the contractor team, we have been resolute with ensuring that we complete as many of the minimum defined requirements from our clients. The LDA algorithm we used, was from an open-source library for topic modelling and natural language processing (Gensim) while our GuidedLDA algorithm further uses the LatentDiricletAllocation (LDA) library and is publicly licensed for use by Vikash Singh.</p>

                                <p>Our deployment of our database uses Azure from a Django app which currently does not have an ongoing cost due to the project being within the limits of the free Azure web app subscription. The web app uses a Django application  We also have a subscription with MongoDB; however, this did not have enough available storage on the free subscription. In order to keep this running for our long term project sustainability, it has an average monthly cost of £8.77.</p>
